# Demos
OpenGL Executables + Shader code

Include a number of OpenGL demos:
* Chromatic Abberation (wavelength-dependent refraction)   =>   \ChromaticAberration
* Normal Mapping couple with single light PBR   =>   \NormalMapping
* Normal-oriented hemisphere sample SSAO with bilinear blur   =>   \SSAO
* DuDv and Normal-Mapped water rendering   =>   \Textures
* IBL (diffuse & specular lighting) Physically Based Rendering   =>   \PBR_IBL // might have some compatibility issues

# To come (compatibility check needed):
* Shell-based fur rendering
* Wiki


N.B: Code and tutorial to come

N.BÂ²: Engine is custom built in C++. Code to come. Above samples serve as a tutorial for said engine
